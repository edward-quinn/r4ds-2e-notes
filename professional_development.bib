	abstract = {This contribution is focused on how to write a research paper when structural equation models are being used in empirical work. The main question to be answered is what information should be reported and what results can be deleted without much loss of judgment about the quality of research and the validity of conclusions being made. The major conjecture is that all information should be reported, or referred to, that enables each member of the scientific community, at least in principle, to replicate the analysis as it is published. The recommendations are ordered in the framework of the empirical research cycle. They are meant for authors, in particular students employing structural equation models for their dissertation, as well as for editors and reviewers.},

	abstract = {A non-arbitrary method for the identification and scale setting of latent variables in general structural equation modeling is introduced. This particular technique provides identical model fit as traditional methods (e.g., the marker variable method), but it allows one to estimate the latent parameters in a nonarbitrary metric that reflects the metric of the measured indicators. This technique, therefore, is particularly useful for mean and covariance structures (MACS) analyses, where the means of the indicators and latent constructs are of key interest. By introducing this alternative method of identification and scale setting, researchers are provided with an additional tool for conducting MACS analyses that provides a meaningful and nonarbitrary scale for the estimates of the latent variable parameters. Importantly, this tool can be used with single-group single-occasion models as well as with multiple-group models, multiple-occasion models, or both.},

	abstract = {Practical and theoretical issues are discussed for testing (a) the comparability, or measurement equivalence, of psychological constructs and (b) detecting possible sociocultural difference on the constructs in cross-cultural research designs. Specifically, strong factorial invariance (Meredith, 1993) of each variable's loading and intercept (mean-level) parameters implies that constructs are fundamentally the same in each sociocultural group, and thus comparable. Under this condition, hypotheses about the nature of sociocultural differences and similarities can be confidently and meaningfully tested among the constructs' moments in each sociocultural sample. Some of the issues involved in making such tests are reviewed and explicated within the framework of multiple-group mean and covariance structures analyses.},
